# DPLL SAT Solver

This project implements the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm in Python to solve the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The DPLL algorithm is a backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

## Features

- Parses CNF formulas from a string input.
- Implements unit propagation and pure literal elimination.
- Performs recursive backtracking with branching and backtracking.
- Provides detailed step-by-step output for debugging and understanding the process.

## Files

- `dpll.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of the DPLL algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/4lirastegar/dpll.git
   cd dpll
   ```
